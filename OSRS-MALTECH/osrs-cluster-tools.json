			"description": "Point-of-sale malware is popular among attackers, as it usually leads to them obtaining credit card numbers and immediately use that information for financial gain. This type of malware is generally deployed on retailers' websites and retail point-of-sale locations with the goal of tracking customers' payment information. If they successfully obtain credit card details, they can use either the proceeds from the sale of that information or use the credit card data directly to obtain additional exploits and resources for other malware. Point-of-sale terminals are often forgotten about in terms of segregation and can represent a soft target for attackers. Cisco Talos recently discovered a new PoS malware that the attackers are selling on a crimeware forum. Our researchers also discovered the associated payloads with the malware, its infrastructure and control panel. We assess with high confidence that this is not the first malware developed by this actor. A few years ago, they were also pushing the DiamondFox L!NK botnet. Known as GlitchPOS, this malware is also being distributed on alternative websites at a higher price than the original.",

In fact, the uptick of macro malware in the first half of 2018 was due to Powload, which was distributed via spam emails. Powload was also one of the most pervasive threats in the North American region in 2018, using various techniques to deliver payloads such as the information-stealing Emotet, Bebloh, and Ursnif. Our Powload detections and the number of related cases/incidents and unique samples we analyzed in 2018 also markedly increased compared to 2017. Powload’s evolving techniques, on the other hand, show how far it’ll go. While its use of spam email as a distribution method could be its constant, it has employed different ways of delivering payloads, from bypassing mitigations like a document’s preview mode to using fileless techniques and hijacking email accounts.",

These droppers are usually disguised as free games, utility applications or adult entertainment applications, yet contain an encrypted malicious payload. The dropper application then checks if any popular applications, such apps include WhatsApp, MXplayer, ShareIt and more from the attacker’s pre-determined list, are installed on the device. If any targeted application is found, Agent Smith will then attack those innocent applications at a later stage. In the second phase, after the dropper gains a foothold on victim device, it automatically decrypts the malicious payload into its original form – an APK (Android installation file) file which serves as the core part of Agent Smiths attack. The dropper then abuses several known system vulnerabilities to install the core malware without any user interaction at all. In the third phase, the core malware conducts attacks against each installed application on device which appears on its target list. The core malware quietly extracts a given innocent application’s APK file, patches it with extra malicious modules and finally abuses a further set of system vulnerabilities to silently swap the innocent version with a malicious one.",

These could be tools to circumvent internet censorship, such as Softether VPN 4.12 and psiphon3, or Microsoft Office activators. The dropper contains a tiny .NET shell that will wait for Windows shell commands from the operators. Using this and SMB shares on rented virtual private servers (VPS), the operators spread the next-stage modules using just net use and copy Windows shell commands. Lateral movements within the target infrastructure show how familiar the operators are with the IPv6 protocol. Along with IPv4 they use the newer version for shell commands and LAN addresses. The purpose of all this infrastructure and modules in JavaScript, .NET and PowerShell is to build a fileless module chain on the victim computer consisting of an initial small runner and several Windows system registry values containing the encrypted remote administration tool. The tool does all that a typical Trojan needs to accomplish: upload, download and execute files, fingerprint target systems.

The resulting file appears as a shell script (many of those have a .run suffix), and can be launched as is. The archive will then uncompress itself to a temporary directory and an optional arbitrary command will be executed (for example an installation script). This is pretty similar to archives generated with WinZip Self-Extractor in the Windows world. The archive contains four files - 1. gnome-shell-ext – the spy agent executable 2. gnome-shell-ext.sh – checks if gnome-shell-ext is already running and if not, executes it 3. rtp.dat – configuration file for gnome-shell-ext 4. setup.sh – the setup script that is run by makeself after unpacking. The setup script installs the agent to ~/.cache/gnome-software/gnome-shell-extensions/, in an attempt to masquerade itself as a Gnome shell extension. Gnome shell extensions allow tweaking the Gnome desktop and add functionalities. They are the desktop equivalent to browser extensions. Persistence is achieved by registering gnome-shell-ext.sh to run every minute in crontab. Finally, the script executes gnome-shell-ext.sh, which in turn launches the main executable gnome-shell-ext.",

			"description": "its GSM plugin uses the AT command protocol, and second, it uses Tor for its network communications. Attor monitors active processes to take screenshots of selected applications. Only certain applications are targeted – those with specific substrings in the process name or window title. The victim’s usage of TrueCrypt is further inspected in another part of Attor. It monitors hard disk devices connected to the compromised computer, and searches for the presence of TrueCrypt. If TrueCrypt is detected, its version is determined by sending IOCTLs to the TrueCrypt driver. As these are TrueCrypt-specific control codes, not standard codes, the authors of the malware must actually understand the open-source code of TrueCrypt installer. Attor consists of a dispatcher and loadable plugins, all of which are implemented as dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). The first step of a compromise comprises dropping all these components on disk and loading the dispatcher DLL. The dispatcher is the core of the whole platform – it serves as a management and synchronization unit for the additional plugins. On each system start, it injects itself into almost all running processes and loads all available plugins within each of these processes. As an exception, Attor avoids injection into some system and security‑product‑related processes. All plugins rely on the dispatcher for implementing basic functionalities. Rather than calling Windows API functions directly, the plugins use a reference to a helper function (a function dispatcher) implemented by the dispatcher DLL. A reference to the function dispatcher is passed to the plugins when they are loaded. Because the plugins are injected in the same process as the dispatcher itself, they share the same address space and are thus able to call this function directly. Calls to the function dispatcher take as their arguments the function type and its numerical identifier. This design makes it harder to analyze individual components of Attor without having access to the dispatcher, as it translates the specified identifier to a meaningful function that is then executed.",

			"description": "NetAgent.exe is a user mode rootkit that provides covert communication with the LOWKEY backdoor component. It forwards incoming packets, after receiving the byte sequence. The component works by hooking the NtDeviceIoControlFile API. It does that by allocating a suspiciously large region of memory, which is used as a global hook table. The table consists of 0x668A0 bytes and has read, write and execute permissions set. Each hook table entry consists of 3 pointers. The first points to memory containing the original 11 bytes of each hooked function, the second entry contains a pointer to the remaining original instructions and the third pointer points to the function hook. The malware will only hook one function in this manner and therefore allocates an unnecessary large amount of memory. The malware was designed to hook up to 10000 functions this way. The hook function begins by iterating the global hook table and compares the pointer to the hook function to itself. This is done to find the original instructions for the installed hook, in this case NtDeviceIoControlFile. The malware then executes the saved instructions which results in a regular NtDeviceIoControlFile API call. Afterwards the IoControlCode is compared to 0x12017 (AFD_RECV). If the IoControlCode does not match, the original API call results are returned. If they match the malware compares the first 12 bytes of the incoming data. As it is effectively a TCP packet, it is parsing the TCP header to get the data of the packet. The first 12 bytes of the data section are compared against the hard-coded byte pattern. If they match it expects to receive additional data, which seems to be unused, and then responds with a 16 byte header, which seems to be hard-coded and to indicate that following packets will be forwarded to the named pipe. The backdoor component (SK3.x.exe) receives and sends data to the named pipe. The hook function will forward all received data from the named pipe back to the socket, effectively allowing a covert communication between the named pipe and the socket.",

Since January 2013, Everything has been actively developed after a four-year break. This utility is released under a free software license that allows modification and commercial redistribution, requiring only attribution. When Everything first runs, it creates an index of the names of every file and folder on all NTFS and ReFS volumes on the system from file metadata, in the case of NTFS from the NTFS Master File Table. By default, all mounted NTFS and ReFS volumes are indexed. Once created, the index is continually updated by the application; in the case of NTFS the updates are fetched from the NTFS change journal. Specific folders on any file system can also be added to the index, but the indexing of folders not using NTFS or ReFS will be slow. The actual search using the gathered index will not be slow, though. Regardless of the file system used on the indexed drives and folders, Everything searches its index for file names matching a user search expression, which may be a fragment of the target file name or a regular expression, displaying intermediate and immediate results as the search term is entered. Because Everything doesn't index content and in the case of NTFS drives relies only on the NTFS change journal to filter file updates, the only file system activity it requires on NTFS drives is updating its index, and it uses very little memory and processor time to provide its service when only indexing NTFS and ReFS drives.Take Command Console incorporates the internal command everything to allow command line access to the program.",

Like most campaigns, Afraidgate switched to Neutrino EK after Angler EK disappeared in early June 2016. Two other large-scale campaigns also moved from Angler to Neutrino EK - the EITest and pseudo-Darkleech campaigns. For now, Neutrino appears to be distributing the majority of ransomware for EK-based infections. Outliers still exist, like Magnitude EK distributing Cerber ransomware. Rig EK has also been noted for an occasional ransomware infection. But the bulk of EK-based ransomware infections are most often attributed to Neutrino EK.",

The first sample is signed by Sectigo RSA Code Signing CA, uses a Flash icon and has the following Version Information. The second sample is not signed and uses an icon that looks like a red floppy disk. The Version Information looks different too but follows a similar pattern of upper and lower case combinations in a jumble of arbitrary words. The threat actor used ConfuserEx to obfuscate the control flow and add anti-tamper to the .NET assembly. The anti-tamper prevents tools like DnSpy from decompiling the code. The assembly has a RemoteClient.Config class containing four public static variables for the configuration - ip, retip, filename, mutexName. The ip is the Command and Control (C&C) server IP. The retip variable is for setting a new C&C IP that the server can override by using the set IP command.
