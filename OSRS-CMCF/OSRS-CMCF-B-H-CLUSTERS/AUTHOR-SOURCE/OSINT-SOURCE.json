      "description": "The origins of the paper lie with The Spartan, a weekly paper reportedly first printed in about 1842–43. In 1844, this was renamed The Carolina Spartan. In about 1900, the paper was reportedly bought by The Journal Publishing Company, which renamed it The Spartanburg Journal. In 1872 (or perhaps 1875), The Spartanburg Herald began publishing. It began daily publication in 1890 the Journal followed suit in 1903. The Herald purchased the Journal in 1914. The Herald was a morning paper, while the Journal covered evenings, with joint editions published on the weekend. Though under common ownership, the Herald and Journal did not completely merge into one paper until October 1982. In 1929, owner The Herald-Journal Publishing Company sold the papers to its paper distributor, the International Paper and Power Company, who sold them to A. G. Keeney in 1936, who in turn sold to S. S. Blue Wallace in 1939. Charles Edward Marsh brought the papers in 1946, and donated them to the non-profit Public Welfare Foundation he had created in 1947. A 1969 federal tax law requiring non-profits to sell newspaper holdings eventually required the sale of the paper. The New York Times acquired the Herald-Journal from the Public Welfare Foundation in 1985 (along with The Tuscaloosa News and The Gadsden Times), at which time its daily circulation was 47,500, and Sunday 51,000. On January 6, 2012, Halifax Media Group completed its purchase of the Herald-Journal and 15 other newspapers from The New York Times. In 2015, Halifax was acquired by New Media Investment Group.",

      "description": "Founded in 2016, we believe there is a simpler, less fragmented way to help security professionals develop a comprehensive security posture by moving away from the single use-case, proprietary, and closed model ubiquitous in the industry today. Our vision incorporates a single open source agent that can collect a wide range of system data, where analytics are applied to solve multiple security challenges across a diverse range of operating systems and computing environments. Inspired by Salesforce and SAP and what they've done for the CRM and business process industries, Uptycs has similarly set out to build a platform that translates business requirements into tables and relational databases. A structured foundation, coupled with SQL, allowed Salesforce and SAP to address diverse functional requirements and create a compelling customer experience, and we hope to do the same. We've paired the open source universal endpoint agent, osquery, with a scalable security analytics platform to enable a unified view for fleet visibility, intrusion detection, vulnerability management and compliance across Linux, macOS, Windows, containers, and cloud workloads. Uptycs collects, aggregates and analyzes your endpoint telemetry and, using SQL, transforms it into dashboards, reports and alerts that enable teams of any size to develop a continuous and proactive security posture.",
