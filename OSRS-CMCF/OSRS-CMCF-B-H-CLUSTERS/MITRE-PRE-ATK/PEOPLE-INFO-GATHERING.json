  "description": "People Information Gathering consists of the process of identifying critical personnel elements of intelligence an adversary will need about a target in order to best attack.  People intelligence gathering focuses on identifying key personnel or individuals with critical accesses in order to best approach a target for attack.  It may involve aspects of social engineering, elicitation, mining social media sources, or be thought of as understanding the personnel element of competitive intelligence.",
