  "description": "Initial Access consists of techniques that use various entry vectors to gain their initial foothold within a network. Techniques used to gain a foothold include targeted spearphishing and exploiting weaknesses on public-facing web servers. Footholds gained through initial access may allow for continued access, like valid accounts and use of external remote services, or may be limited-use due to changing passwords. The OSRS MITRE Combined Enterprise ATT&CK combines the following matrices - Windows, Linux, AWS, GCP, Azure, and SaaS into a single MISP mapping.",
