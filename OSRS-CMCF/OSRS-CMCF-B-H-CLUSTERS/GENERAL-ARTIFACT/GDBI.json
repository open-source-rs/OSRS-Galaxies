      "description": "Business email compromise attacks (BEC) is a form of cyber crime which uses email fraud to attack commercial, Government and non-profit organizations to achieve a specific outcome which negatively impacts the targets organization. Examples of common BEC attacks include invoice scams and spear phishing spoof attacks which are designed to gather data for other criminal activities. Often consumer privacy breaches occur as a results of a BEC attack. Typically an attack targets specific employee roles within an organization by sending a spoof email (or series of spoof emails) which fraudulently represent a senior colleague (CEO or similar) or a trusted customer. The email will issue instructions such as approving payments or releasing client data. The emails often use social engineering to trick the victim into making money transfers to the bank accounts of the fraudster.",

The threat may involve fraud, the theft of confidential or commercially valuable information, the theft of intellectual property, or the sabotage of computer systems. The insider threat comes in three categories - malicious insiders, which are people who take advantage of their access to inflict harm on an organization, negligent insiders which are people who make errors and disregard policies which place their organizations at risk, and Infiltrators who are external actors that obtain legitimate access credentials without authorization.",

While some simple ransomware may lock the system in a way which is not difficult for a knowledgeable person to reverse, more advanced malware uses a technique called cryptoviral extortion, in which it encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom payment to decrypt them. In a properly implemented cryptoviral extortion attack, recovering the files without the decryption key is an intractable problem â€“ and difficult to trace digital currencies such as Ukash or Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency are used for the ransoms, making tracing and prosecuting the perpetrators difficult. Ransomware attacks are typically carried out using a Trojan that is disguised as a legitimate file that the user is tricked into downloading or opening when it arrives as an email attachment. However, one high-profile example, the WannaCry worm, travelled automatically between computers without user interaction.",
