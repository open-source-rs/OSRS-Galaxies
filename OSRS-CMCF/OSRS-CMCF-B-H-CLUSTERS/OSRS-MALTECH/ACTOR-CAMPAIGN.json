Stylistically, the observed tradecraft resembles activity from groups such as COBALT GYPSY (which is related to OilRig, Crambus, and APT34) and COBALT TRINITY (also known as Elfin and APT33). However, none of the collected malware or infrastructure associated with LYCEUM has direct links to observed activity from these or other known threat groups. As of this publication, there is insufficient technical evidence to support an attribution assessment. When CTU researchers first published information about LYCEUM to Secureworks Threat Intelligence clients, no public documentation on the group existed. Since then, reporting has emerged that refers to the threat group as HEXANE.",

      "description": "INDRIK SPIDER is a sophisticated eCrime group that has been operating Dridex since June 2014. In 2015 and 2016, Dridex was one of the most prolific eCrime banking trojans on the market and, since 2014, those efforts are thought to have netted INDRIK SPIDER millions of dollars in criminal profits. Throughout its years of operation, Dridex has received multiple updates with new modules developed and new anti-analysis features added to the malware. In August 2017, a new ransomware variant identified as BitPaymer was reported to have ransomed the U.K.’s National Health Service (NHS), with a high ransom demand of 53 BTC (approximately $200,000 USD). The targeting of an organization rather than individuals, and the high ransom demands, made BitPaymer stand out from other contemporary ransomware at the time. Though the encryption and ransom functionality of BitPaymer was not technically sophisticated, the malware contained multiple anti-analysis features that overlapped with Dridex. Later technical analysis of BitPaymer indicated that it had been developed by INDRIK SPIDER, suggesting the group had expanded its criminal operation to include ransomware as a monetization strategy.",

All of the impacted online shops are hosted on the cloud platform of the e-commerce service provider Volusion, one of the top e-commerce platforms in the market. Discovery of malicious code injected into a JavaScript library provided by Volusion to their client shops. The injected code loaded another JavaScript stored on a Google Storage service. The loaded script is almost a direct copy of a normal JavaScript library but has a credit card skimmer carefully integrated. When customers submit their payment information, the skimmer will copy and send the personal information and credit card details to an exfiltration server belonging to the attackers. During an investigation, it was found that the attackers seemed more experienced and thoughtful than many other skimmer groups. They did not simply add their malicious code at the top or end of a script; instead, they carefully integrated the code into the original script to be part of the execution flow of the program. The code was also written as simply as possible, making it difficult to be identified in a big library. Furthermore, they registered the domain of their exfiltration server in a similar style to a legitimate Volusion domain. Considering the modus operandi, it is believed the attackers are from Magecart Group 6, which has also been identified as the notorious threat actor FIN6. Similarities in the code used in this attack and the code used in FIN6’s previous attacks on British Airways and Newegg.",

These new implants were used until very recently, with the latest observed sample being deployed in June 2019.

A peculiar Italian-origin malware campaign has been discovered by security researchers. It appears that this campaign has been active since 2016, and came to light only this year. First analyzed by TG Soft and then by Yoroi-Zlab, the attacker group is speculated to be Italian since many file names and scripts were in the Italian language, as well as C2 servers being from Italy. It was also observed that the Pistacchietto campaign targeted both mobile and desktop systems.",

      "description": "For three years, Unit 42 has tracked a set of cyber espionage attack campaigns across Asia, which used a mix of publicly available and custom malware. Unit 42 created the moniker PKPLUG for the threat actor group, or groups, behind these and other documented attacks referenced later in this report. The name comes from the tactic of delivering PlugX malware inside ZIP archive files as part of a DLL side-loading package. The ZIP file format contains the ASCII magic-bytes PK in its header, hence PKPLUG. While tracking these attackers, Unit 42 discovered additional, mostly custom malware families being used by PKPLUG beyond that of just PlugX. The additional payloads include HenBox, an Android app, and Farseer, a Windows backdoor. The attackers also use the 9002 Trojan, which is believed to be shared among a small subset of attack groups. Other publicly available malware seen in relation to PKPLUG activity includes Poison Ivy and Zupdax. Currently victims lay mainly in and around the Southeast Asia region, particularly Myanmar, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Indonesia; and likely also in various other areas in Asia, such as Tibet, Xinjiang, and Mongolia. Based on targeting, content in some of the malware and ties to infrastructure previously documented publicly as being linked to Chinese nation-state adversaries, Unit 42 believes with high confidence that PKPLUG has similar origins.",

      "description": "Between November 2018 and May 2019, senior members of Tibetan groups received malicious links in individually tailored WhatsApp text exchanges with operators posing as NGO workers, journalists, and other fake personas. The links led to code designed to exploit web browser vulnerabilities to install spyware on iOS and Android devices, and in some cases to OAuth phishing pages. This campaign was carried out by what appears to be a single threat operator POISON CARP. POISON CARP employs a total of eight Android browser exploits and one Android spyware kit, as well as one iOS exploit chain and iOS spyware. None of the exploits observed were zero days. POISON CARP overlaps with two recently reported campaigns against the Uyghur community. The iOS exploit and spyware we observed was used in watering hole attacks reported by Google Project Zero, and a website used to serve exploits by POISON CARP was also observed in a campaign called Evil Eye reported by Volexity. The Android malware used in the campaign is a fully featured spyware kit that has not been previously documented. POISON CARP appears to have used Android browser exploits from a variety of sources. In one case, POISON CARP used a working exploit publicly released by Exodus Intelligence for a Google Chrome bug that was fixed in source, but whose patch had not yet been distributed to Chrome users. In other cases, POISON CARP used lightly modified versions of Chrome exploit code published on the personal GitHub pages of a member of Qihoo 360’s Vulcan Team, a member of Tencent’s Xuanwu Lab, and by a Google Project Zero member on the Chrome Bug Tracker. This campaign is the first documented case of one-click mobile exploits used to target Tibetan groups, and reflects an escalation in the sophistication of digital espionage threats targeting the community.",

The group consistently targets suppliers and vendors in their initial attacks, using phishing emails to encourage employees to divulge passwords, which can then be used to access the email account. Once this information is available, Silent Starling sets up a forwarding rule so the group receives copies of all emails into the account. From there, Silent Starling diverges from a typical BEC group by showing extreme patience—oftentimes waiting months to gather information about employee behavior, standard invoice design, and other financial information that will be useful in an attack. When the time is right, the group will strike. At this point, they use either the original compromised account (or one very similar) to target the vendor’s customer, asking for payment on an invoice. And because the email looks exactly like one they are expecting, only with updated banking details, the customer is likely to fall for the scam.",

For their campaigns in Germany, the actor chose Cobalt Strike, a commercially licensed software tool that is generally used for penetration testing and emulates the type of backdoor framework used by Metasploit, a similar penetration testing tool. The product describes itself as adversary simulation software designed to execute targeted attacks and emulate the post-exploitation actions of advanced threat actors, and is intended for use by organizations to secure their environments. However, despite its extensive legitimate use as a simulation tool, various actors have deployed and executed campaigns using it as actual malware, including Cobalt Group, APT32, and APT19. Proofpoint researchers have also observed this actor distributing Maze ransomware, employing similar social engineering techniques to those it uses for Cobalt Strike, while also targeting organizations in Italy and impersonating the Agenzia Delle Entrate, the Italian Revenue Agency.

All the victims we registered were organizations from the Middle East. At least some of them are related to industrial sector. Our Kaspersky Threat Attribution Engine (KTAE) doesn’t show any code similarities with known campaigns. Nor have we seen any target intersections. In fact, we found just three almost unique samples, all in one country. So we consider the attacks to be targeted and have currently named this operation WildPressure. The compilation timestamps for all these files is the same – March 2019. This is consistent with the fact that we registered no infections before May 31, 2019, so the compilation dates don’t seem to be spoofed. For their campaign infrastructure, the operators used rented OVH and Netzbetrieb virtual private servers (VPS) and a domain registered with the Domains by Proxy anonymization service. The malware uses the JSON format for configuration data and as a C2 communication protocol over HTTP as well. Inside the encrypted communications within the HTTP POST requests, we found several interesting fields. One of them shows the malware version – 1.0.1. A version number like this indicates an early stage of development. Other fields suggest the existence of, at the very least, plans for non-C++ versions. The only encryption implemented is the RC4 algorithm with different 64-byte keys for different victims. Also, the developers were kind enough to leave RTTI data inside the files.",
