      "description": "RDP, the remote desktop protocol, made the news recently after Microsoft patched a critical remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2019-0708). While the reporting around this Bluekeep vulnerability focused on patching vulnerable servers, exposing RDP to the Internet has never been a good idea. Botnets have been scanning for these servers and are using weak and reused passwords to gain access to them. The latest example of such a botnet is an ongoing malicious campaign we are refering to as GoldBrute. This botnet is currently brute forcing a list of about 1.5 million RDP servers exposed to the Internet. Shdoan lists about 2.4 million exposed servers. GoldBrute uses its own list and is extending it as it continues to scan and grow. The GoldBrute botnet is controlled by a single command and control server. Bots are exchanging data with it via AES encrypted WebSocket connections to port 8333. An infected system will first be instructed to download the bot code. The download is very large (80 MBytes) and includes the complete Java Runtime. The bot itself is implemented in a Java class called GoldBrute. Initially, the bot will start scanning random IP addresses to find more hosts with exposed RDP servers. These IPs are reported back to the C&C server. After the bot reported 80 new victims, the C&C server will assign a set of targets to brute force to the bot. Each bot will only try one particular username and password per target. This is possibly a strategy to fly under the radar of security tools as each authentication attempt comes from different addresses.",

So, it needs a dropping scheme to go to the infected host beforehand, making a malicious process called cloudprocess, send message of airdopping clouds through the standard output that can be piped later on. It is recording its PID and fork its process for the further step. The message of airdropping clouds is the this botnet is called AirDropBot; eventhough the coder prefer to use Cloudbot, which there is also a legitimate good software that uses that name too as their brand. Upon successful forking it will extract the what the coder so-called encrypted array, it's ala Mirai table crypted keywords in its concept, but it is different in implementation. It could be originally coded to avoid XOR operation which is the worst Mirai bug, but this encrypt_array is just ending up to an encoded obfuscation function. The value from this decrypted coded is used for further malware process. Then the malware tries to connect to the C2 which its IP address is hard-coded in the binary, on a success connection attempt to C2 server, it will parse the commands sent by the C2 to perform three weaponized functions on the binary to perform TCP, and UDP DDoS attack with either using the specific hex-coded payload, or the latter on is using a custom pattern so-called hex-attack that sends DoS packet in a hex escape strings format to the targeted host.",

It has been active since at least May 2019 and, since then, three different variants of the initial module have been identified, in addition to approximately 10 secondary payloads that are downloaded from file hosting websites. The initial module is detected by ESET security products as MSIL/VictoryGate. This botnet is composed mainly of devices in Latin America, specifically Peru, where over 90% of the compromised devices are located. Weâ€™ve been actively sinkholing several command and control (C&C) domains, allowing us to monitor this botnetâ€™s activity. The combination of the sinkhole data and our telemetry data allows us to estimate the botnetâ€™s size to be at least 35,000 devices. To control its botnet, VictoryGate used only subdomains registered at the dynamic DNS provider No-IP. ESET reported the malicious subdomains to No-IP, who swiftly took them all down, effectively removing control of the bots from the attacker. Also, ESET is collaborating with non-profit Shadowserver Foundation by sharing sinkhole logs in an effort to further remediate this threat.",

For regular Mirai and their variations, normally the changes are fairly minor, changing C2s or encryption keys, or integrate some new vulnerabilities, nothing dramatic. But this one is different. Its encryption method is unique, and communication protocol is more rigorous. Also it is very likely a new branch from the Moobot group and is in active development.

The actor is also aware of the latest SMB vulnerabilities such as SMBGhost, but no evidence of using this exploit has been found. The botnet has more than 15 executable modules that all get downloaded and driven by the main module, which constantly communicates with the command and control (C2) server over HTTP. However, the encrypted data is sent using RC4 encryption, and the module shares the key with the C2 using asymmetric encryption. Apart from a large focus on spreading across the environment, Prometei also tries to recover administrator passwords.

It was found the malware eventually allowed attackers to execute arbitrary PowerShell commands on the victimâ€™s Windows machine.

We have also detected a macOS variant. The macOS variant and most of the Linux samples are fully undetected in VirusTotal at the time of this publication. IPStorm is written in Golang, which enabled Intezer Analyze to detect cross-platform code connections between the Linux samples and the Windows malware first reported by Anomali. The Linux variant has additional features over the documented Windows version, such as using SSH brute-force as a means to spread to additional victims and fraudulent network activity abusing Steam gaming and advertising platforms. The Linux variant has adjusted some features in order to account for the fundamental differences that exist between this operating system and Windows.",

Security researchers from Imperva â€”who analyzed the botnet last week in a two-part seriesâ€” said the botnet's primary purpose appears to be to infect websites and then use their servers for cryptocurrency mining, redirecting a site's legitimate traffic to spam pages, and to a lesser degree, showing web defacements. Imperva said the botnet started out small, but after months of constant growth, it has evolved into a sophisticated behemoth capable of attacking thousands of sites per day. The biggest changes occurred in May this year when the botnet increased both its command-and-control (C&C) infrastructure, but also its exploit arsenal. Nowadays, KashmirBlack is managed by one C&C (Command and Control) server and uses more than 60 â€“ mostly innocent surrogate â€“ servers as part of its infrastructure, Imperva said. The botnet handles hundreds of bots, each communicating with the C&C to receive new targets, perform brute force attacks, install backdoors, and expand the size of the botnet.",

      "description": "The malware is a variant of SystemdMiner, which consists of a series of Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) binaries and Unix shell scripts. Some components of the botnet have been analyzed in the past with the malware dating back to early 2019. Many of the DreamBus modules are poorly detected by security products. This is in part because Linux-based malware is less common than Windows-based malware, and thus receives less scrutiny from the security community. However, many critical business systems run on Linux systems, and malware that is able to gain access to these systems can cause significant disruption and irreparable harm to organizations that fail to secure their servers properly. The DreamBus malware exhibits worm-like behavior that is highly effective in spreading due its multifaceted approach to propagating itself across the internet and laterally through an internal network using a variety of methods. These techniques include numerous modules that exploit implicit trust, weak passwords, and unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities in popular applications, including Secure Shell (SSH), IT administration tools, a variety of cloud-based applications, and databases. These particular applications are targeted because they often run on systems that have powerful underlying hardware with significant amounts of memory and powerful CPUsâ€”all of which allow threat actors to maximize their ability to monetize these resources through mining cryptocurrency. While the primary DreamBus malware payload is an open source Monero cryptocurrency miner known as XMRig, the threat actor can potentially pivot in the future to carrying out more destructive activities, such as ransomware or stealing an organizationâ€™s data and holding it hostage.",

This anomaly caught our attention, and after analysis, we determined that it was a new botnet that reused the Mirai framework, propagated through the ADB interface, and targeted Android-like devices with the main purpose of DDoS attacks. It redesigns the encryption algorithm and obtains TOR C2 and the TOR proxys from remote hosts via DNS TXT. The encryption algorithm implemented in this botnet and the process of obtaining C2 are nested in layers, like Russian nesting dolls. For this reason we named it Matryosh. As the analysis progresses, more details emerge. Based on the similarity of C2 instructions, we speculate that it is another attempt by the Moobot group, which is very active at the moment. Matryosh has no integrated scanning, vulnerability exploitation modules, the main function is DDoS attack, it supports tcpraw, icmpecho, and udpplain attacks.",

It is worth noting that both the scanner and miner modules are implanted separately by the loader, and they have no binding relationship in the code. Based on the samples, researchers infer that the scanner should be the starting module. After the target host is scanned and reported, the attacker can either choose to continue to implant the scanner module or the miner module. In theory, the attacker may also implant other functional modules.",
