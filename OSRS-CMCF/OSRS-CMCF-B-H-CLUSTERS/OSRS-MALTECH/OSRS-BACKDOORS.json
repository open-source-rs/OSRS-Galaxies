      "description": "A backdoor that can be used on linux and windows systems. Both instances of this malware are practically identical in terms of overall functionality, with minor implementation differences. Both malware instances share the same protocol to communicate with the same CNC server. However, these instances have different delivery vectors. The windows instance has been observed being delivered by the Fallout Exploit Kit. The main function is not obfuscated and appears to be straightforward in logic. In the Windows variant we can see how some strings are decoded in the beginning of the function. After initial string decoding the malware serializes the victim by collecting architecture, system, and MAC address information. The way the Windows variant collects this information is by calling the correspondent Windows API functions in order to retrieve the subject information such as IsWow64Process. The Linux variant, on the other hand, uses a different technique that mainly relies on uname system call to retrieve architecture and system information, in addition to a combination of socket as well as ioctl system calls to retrieve the MAC address. After victim information has been serialized, the malware will apply some persistence mechanisms. The Windows instance will initialize a registry entry so that the malware will be executed on system start-up. The Linux instance will set up various symbolic links and add an initrd script for the malware to also run on system start-up.",

      "description": "During analysis of the xHunt campaign, researchers from UNIT42 observed several domains with ties to the pasta58.com domain associated with known Sakabota command and control (C2) activity. In June 2019, they also observed one of these overlapping domains, specifically, windows64x.com, being used as the C2 server for a new PowerShell based backdoor that has been named by UNIT42 researchers as CASHY200. This PowerShell backdoor used DNS tunneling to communicate with its C2 server, specifically by issuing DNS A queries to the actor controlled name server at the aforementioned domain. CASHY200 parses data provided by the C2 server within DNS answers to run commands on the system and send the results back to the C2 via DNS queries. In several samples, CASHY200 used randomly generated identifiers that are stored in the registry and used the command value 200 to communicate with the C2 server. By analyzing the lineage of this tool, UNIT42 researchers found that actors may have used CASHY200 when targeting Kuwaiti government organizations starting in the spring of 2018 and continuing throughout 2019.",
