      "description": "Agent Smith has three primary phases in its attack flow. In the first phase, the attacker lures users to download a dropper application from an app store such as 9Apps. These droppers are usually disguised as free games, utility applications or adult entertainment applications, yet contain an encrypted malicious payload. The dropper application then checks if any popular applications, such apps include WhatsApp, MXplayer, ShareIt and more from the attacker’s pre-determined list, are installed on the device. If any targeted application is found, Agent Smith will then attack those innocent applications at a later stage. In the second phase, after the dropper gains a foothold on victim device, it automatically decrypts the malicious payload into its original form – an APK (Android installation file) file which serves as the core part of Agent Smiths attack. The dropper then abuses several known system vulnerabilities to install the core malware without any user interaction at all. In the third phase, the core malware conducts attacks against each installed application on device which appears on its target list. The core malware quietly extracts a given innocent application’s APK file, patches it with extra malicious modules and finally abuses a further set of system vulnerabilities to silently swap the innocent version with a malicious one.",

      "description": "Its GSM plugin uses the AT command protocol, and second, it uses Tor for its network communications. Attor monitors active processes to take screenshots of selected applications. Only certain applications are targeted – those with specific substrings in the process name or window title. The victim’s usage of TrueCrypt is further inspected in another part of Attor. It monitors hard disk devices connected to the compromised computer, and searches for the presence of TrueCrypt. If TrueCrypt is detected, its version is determined by sending IOCTLs to the TrueCrypt driver. As these are TrueCrypt-specific control codes, not standard codes, the authors of the malware must actually understand the open-source code of TrueCrypt installer. Attor consists of a dispatcher and loadable plugins, all of which are implemented as dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). The first step of a compromise comprises dropping all these components on disk and loading the dispatcher DLL. The dispatcher is the core of the whole platform – it serves as a management and synchronization unit for the additional plugins. On each system start, it injects itself into almost all running processes and loads all available plugins within each of these processes. As an exception, Attor avoids injection into some system and security‑product‑related processes. All plugins rely on the dispatcher for implementing basic functionalities. Rather than calling Windows API functions directly, the plugins use a reference to a helper function (a function dispatcher) implemented by the dispatcher DLL. A reference to the function dispatcher is passed to the plugins when they are loaded. Because the plugins are injected in the same process as the dispatcher itself, they share the same address space and are thus able to call this function directly. Calls to the function dispatcher take as their arguments the function type and its numerical identifier. This design makes it harder to analyze individual components of Attor without having access to the dispatcher, as it translates the specified identifier to a meaningful function that is then executed.",

In the first, the attacker sends a local file which will be executed on the victim machine with a given command line argument. In the 2nd mode, the attacker runs an arbitrary shell command without the need to send an actual file. These functionalities are supported in both 32 and 64 bit versions.

According to telemetry, DePriMon has been active since at least March 2017. DePriMon was detected in a private company, based in Central Europe, and at dozens of computers in the Middle East. Some of the domain names used as C&C servers contain Arabic words, which gives an indication of a region-specific campaign.

      "description": "Everything is a desktop search utility for Windows that can rapidly find files and folders by name. Since January 2013, Everything has been actively developed after a four-year break. This utility is released under a free software license that allows modification and commercial redistribution, requiring only attribution. When Everything first runs, it creates an index of the names of every file and folder on all NTFS and ReFS volumes on the system from file metadata, in the case of NTFS from the NTFS Master File Table. By default, all mounted NTFS and ReFS volumes are indexed. Once created, the index is continually updated by the application; in the case of NTFS the updates are fetched from the NTFS change journal. Specific folders on any file system can also be added to the index, but the indexing of folders not using NTFS or ReFS will be slow. The actual search using the gathered index will not be slow, though. Regardless of the file system used on the indexed drives and folders, Everything searches its index for file names matching a user search expression, which may be a fragment of the target file name or a regular expression, displaying intermediate and immediate results as the search term is entered. Because Everything doesn't index content and in the case of NTFS drives relies only on the NTFS change journal to filter file updates, the only file system activity it requires on NTFS drives is updating its index, and it uses very little memory and processor time to provide its service when only indexing NTFS and ReFS drives.Take Command Console incorporates the internal command everything to allow command line access to the program.",

      "description": "This implant is delivered in the form of a self-extracting archive shell script created with makeself. makeself.sh is a small shell script that generates a self-extractable compressed tar archive from a directory. The resulting file appears as a shell script (many of those have a .run suffix), and can be launched as is. The archive will then uncompress itself to a temporary directory and an optional arbitrary command will be executed (for example an installation script). This is pretty similar to archives generated with WinZip Self-Extractor in the Windows world. The archive contains four files - 1. gnome-shell-ext – the spy agent executable 2. gnome-shell-ext.sh – checks if gnome-shell-ext is already running and if not, executes it 3. rtp.dat – configuration file for gnome-shell-ext 4. setup.sh – the setup script that is run by makeself after unpacking. The setup script installs the agent to ~/.cache/gnome-software/gnome-shell-extensions/, in an attempt to masquerade itself as a Gnome shell extension. Gnome shell extensions allow tweaking the Gnome desktop and add functionalities. They are the desktop equivalent to browser extensions. Persistence is achieved by registering gnome-shell-ext.sh to run every minute in crontab. Finally, the script executes gnome-shell-ext.sh, which in turn launches the main executable gnome-shell-ext.",

If they successfully obtain credit card details, they can use either the proceeds from the sale of that information or use the credit card data directly to obtain additional exploits and resources for other malware. Point-of-sale terminals are often forgotten about in terms of segregation and can represent a soft target for attackers. Cisco Talos recently discovered a new PoS malware that the attackers are selling on a crimeware forum.

      "description": "NetAgent.exe is a user mode rootkit that provides covert communication with the LOWKEY backdoor component. It forwards incoming packets, after receiving the byte sequence. The component works by hooking the NtDeviceIoControlFile API. It does that by allocating a suspiciously large region of memory, which is used as a global hook table. The table consists of 0x668A0 bytes and has read, write and execute permissions set. Each hook table entry consists of 3 pointers. The first points to memory containing the original 11 bytes of each hooked function, the second entry contains a pointer to the remaining original instructions and the third pointer points to the function hook. The malware will only hook one function in this manner and therefore allocates an unnecessary large amount of memory. The malware was designed to hook up to 10000 functions this way. The hook function begins by iterating the global hook table and compares the pointer to the hook function to itself. This is done to find the original instructions for the installed hook, in this case NtDeviceIoControlFile. The malware then executes the saved instructions which results in a regular NtDeviceIoControlFile API call. Afterwards the IoControlCode is compared to 0x12017 (AFD_RECV). If the IoControlCode does not match, the original API call results are returned. If they match the malware compares the first 12 bytes of the incoming data. As it is effectively a TCP packet, it is parsing the TCP header to get the data of the packet. The first 12 bytes of the data section are compared against the hard-coded byte pattern. If they match it expects to receive additional data, which seems to be unused, and then responds with a 16 byte header, which seems to be hard-coded and to indicate that following packets will be forwarded to the named pipe. The backdoor component (SK3.x.exe) receives and sends data to the named pipe. The hook function will forward all received data from the named pipe back to the socket, effectively allowing a covert communication between the named pipe and the socket.",

Our Powload detections and the number of related cases/incidents and unique samples we analyzed in 2018 also markedly increased compared to 2017. Powload’s evolving techniques, on the other hand, show how far it’ll go.

November 2019. Using the following Yara rule we were able to obtain a second sample that was compiled on 14. November 2019 and submitted a day later to Virustotal. The first sample is signed by Sectigo RSA Code Signing CA, uses a Flash icon and has the following Version Information. The second sample is not signed and uses an icon that looks like a red floppy disk. The Version Information looks different too but follows a similar pattern of upper and lower case combinations in a jumble of arbitrary words. The threat actor used ConfuserEx to obfuscate the control flow and add anti-tamper to the .NET assembly. The anti-tamper prevents tools like DnSpy from decompiling the code. The assembly has a RemoteClient.Config class containing four public static variables for the configuration - ip, retip, filename, mutexName. The ip is the Command and Control (C&C) server IP. The retip variable is for setting a new C&C IP that the server can override by using the set IP command.

Using this and SMB shares on rented virtual private servers (VPS), the operators spread the next-stage modules using just net use and copy Windows shell commands. Lateral movements within the target infrastructure show how familiar the operators are with the IPv6 protocol. Along with IPv4 they use the newer version for shell commands and LAN addresses. The purpose of all this infrastructure and modules in JavaScript, .NET and PowerShell is to build a fileless module chain on the victim computer consisting of an initial small runner and several Windows system registry values containing the encrypted remote administration tool.

Attackers can purchase a one month license to the RAT for as little as $65 or $175 for a three-month license, which provides the following advertised features - login credential theft, remote Desktop capabilities, upload and download files, execute remote commands on the infected computer, encrypted connections, supports Windows XP through Windows 10, and standard support. While each buyer of the Parallax RAT determines how they will distribute the malware, researchers are commonly seeing it being distributed through spam with malicious attachments. When the attachment is opened, an attempt to exploit the Microsoft Office Equation Editor vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882) will be launched and if the content is enabled, malicious macros will execute to install the RAT. Once Parallax is installed, a shortcut to the launcher will be added to the Windows Startup folder so that it is launched automatically when a user logs into the system. In some cases, scheduled tasks will also be created to launch the malware at various intervals.",

The primary purpose of this loader was to download additional payloads. The samples contacted three unique URLs, all of which were hosted on Google Drive. It used a hard-coded user agent string in order to contact Gdrive. Once the rekt loader contacted the three Google Drive URLs, it downloads the following files - 7zip.exe (a benign program used to compressed or decompress files), a batch file, and a password-protected 7zip file. The rekt loader would then run the batch file. This batch file utilized the 7zip executable to decompress the folder and entered the requisite password. Once decompressed the files were redirected to the directory APPDATA. Afterward, it would add a Run registry key for persistence to start host.exe. The registry key modified was HKEY_CURRENT_USER_Software_Microsoft_Windows_CurrentVersion_Run. Next, it would start the host.exe file that was downloaded and following completion, kill the rundll32.exe files, change the TEMP directory and finally delete the batch file, and the 7zip executable.",

The dropper uses an old trick in a new way. It appends the RAT to a Word document. Upon opening the document, a macro is executed that will extract the malware and execute it. The operation seems to be manual, but it's streamlined to deploy additional tools as needed and to avoid unnecessary steps. The initial foothold is established by sending the malicious Word document. It's not clear at this time how the adversary distributes the document. However, given that it is available for download from a basic URL, it wouldn't be surprising if the victims were being tricked into downloading it by an email or social media network message.",

      "description": "Trojan designed to target the database. The infection process starts when an attacker discovers, and exploits, a zero-day SQL injection remote code execution vulnerability. The exploit of this vulnerability resulted in the attacker being able to insert a one-line command into a database table. This initial injected command triggers an affected device to download a Linux shell script named Install.sh from a remote server on the malicious domain sophosfirewallupdate[.]com. The command also wrote this shell script to the _tmp directory on the device, used the chmod program to designate the file as executable, and executed it. The script (written to the appliance as x.sh) ran a series of SQL commands and dropped additional files into the virtual file system to lay the groundwork for the rest of the attack. The Install.sh script, initially, ran a number of Postgres SQL commands to modify or zero out the values of certain tables in the database, one of which normally displays the administrative IP address of the device itself. It appears that this was an attempt to conceal the attack, but it backfired: On some appliances, the shell script’s activity resulted in the attacker’s own injected SQL command line being displayed on the user interface of the firewall’s administrative panel. In place of what should have been an address, it showed a line of shell commands.",

It attacks its victims by displaying fake pop-up windows that try to persuade victims to divulge sensitive information. Grandoreiro, as with any other Latin American banking trojan, employs backdoor functionality, being capable of 1) manipulating windows, 2) updating itself, 3) capturing keystrokes, 4) simulating mouse and keyboard actions, 5) navigating the victim’s browser to a chosen URL, 6) logging the victim out or restarting the machine, 7) blocking access to chosen websites, and 8) Persistence is ensured by creating a .LNK file in the Windows startup directory. Of importance is the fact that Grandoreiro uses the same algorithm for decrypting its internal strings as Casbaneiro. We believe this is due to information sharing between authors of banking trojans in Latin America. Grandoreiro collects the following information about its victims 1) computer name, 2) username, 3) operating system version and bitness, 4) whether Diebold Warsaw GAS Tecnologia (an application, popular in Brazil, to protect access to online banking) is installed, and 5) list of installed security products.",

      "description": "The first version of EVILNUM was identified in 2018. The second version was discovered in an unrelated incident response investigation a year later, having infiltrated a FINTECH company. The initial reporting on this malware was the only sign of its presence, as it briefly faded from view. This agent was delivered to victims from a URL on a cloud-platform that hosts a zip file. If the link is clicked, the victim downloads a compressed folder riddled with trojanized files that masquerade as PDFs and JPEGs. These files display themselves as seemingly innocuous decoys to the end user, all while quietly running in the background. The first version of EVILNUM malware was observed and reported in 2018. The second version was reported by Palo Alto, targeting a specific financial technology (FinTech) organization. This report covers the latest versions 3.6 and 4.0, how they’re delivered, evasion techniques, and communications channels. The infection chain begins when the victim receives a link to a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) hosted on a cloud-based platform, in this case GoogleDrive. This technique is increasingly used to avoid intrusion detection system (IDS) rules, by hosting the malicious file on a 3rd party platform that was likely whitelisted. When that link is clicked and traffic to GoogleDrive is initiated, it begins the process of downloading a compressed folder from that location.",

It has four embedded resources in which two of them are in Chinese Simplified language. This is an indicator that suggests this campaign is likely operated by a Chinese APT group. The loader starts its process by escalating privilege through a UAC bypass using the CMSTPLUA COM interface. MgBot uses several anti-analysis and anti-virtualization techniques. The code is self modifying which means it alters its code sections during runtime. This makes static analysis of the sample harder. MgBot tries to avoid running in known virtualized environment such as VmWare, Sandboxie and VirtualBox. To identify if it’s running in one of these environments, it looks for the following DLL files - vmhgfs.dll, sbiedll.dll and vboxogl.dll and if it finds any of these DLLs, it goes to an infinite loop without doing any malicious activity.",

Cerberus being discontinued, its customers seem to be switching to Alien, which has become the prominent new MaaS for fraudsters. Looking at what researchers know now about what happened with Cerberus and Alien, researchers could speculate that Cerberus was on the decline as the developers behind the Trojan shifted away from the project with the original source in order to start their own. Interestingly enough, this speculation is corroborated by the fact that when the second version of Cerberus (v2) was released in May 2020, it did not introduce any major new features, except for the one to steal 2FA codes from Google’s authenticator app. The code of that feature code is almost identical to that introduced with the Alien Trojan in February 2020. This indicates that at that time, the developer behind the Cerberus Trojan had access to, and might have been responsible for development of the Alien code.",

In addition to DDoS attacks, it implements 12 remote access functions such as Socket5 proxy for router devices, tampering with router DNS, setting iptables, executing custom system commands. In addition, at the C2 communication level, it uses the WSS (WebSocket over TLS) protocol. Doing this can circumvent the typical Mirai traffic detection at the traffic level, and it also provides secure encrypted communication for C2. About the infrastructure, the attacker first used a Google cloud service IP, and then switched to a hosting provider in Hong Kong.

When victims see WerFault.exe running on their machine, they probably assume that some error happened, while in this case they have actually been targeted in an attack.

The malware, coined Vizom by the team, uses familiar remote overlay attack tactics to take over user devices in real time, as the intended victim logs in, and then initiates fraudulent transactions from their bank account. What we found interesting about Vizom, is the way it infects and deploys on user devices. It uses ‘DLL hijacking’ to sneak into legitimate directories on Windows-based machines, masked as a legitimate, popular video conferencing software, and tricks the operating system’s inherent logic to load its malicious Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) before it loads the legitimate ones that belong in that address space. It uses similar tactics to operate the attack.",

Osno does the installation itself. Just like the rootkit installer, Osno registers the rootkit DLL to AppInit_DLLs and enables LoadAppInit_DLLs so it is loaded with every process. Because the rookit DLLs are not signed, it sets RequireSignedAppInit_DLLs to 0. The rootkit uses MinHook to redirect WinAPI calls, so that it hides processes and file names, e.g., from explorer and taskmanager. The proof-of-concept binaries for the rootkit hide files and processes that start with $77. Since Osno uses the proof-of-concept binaries, it needs to add the prefix $77 to its own files to make it work.",

On the same day, the FBI released a public threat analysis report describing several tools used by Rana Corp, a front company backed by the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) which is behind the malicious cyber activities conducted by the APT39 group. The tools described in the aforementioned report are implemented using different technologies including VisualBasic and Autoit scripts, Android applications and the more common PE executables. According to the report, the focus of Rana’s cyber activities is tracking the movements of individuals whom the MOIS considers a threat. In today’s world, the most valuable source of such information are smartphones. You carry a smartphone almost the entire time, and, besides being the main tool for everyday communication, smartphones also provide a large set of secondary functionalities, including visual and audio recording and location services. Because of all these capabilities, gaining control over someone’s smartphone provides the malicious actor with a powerful espionage tool. For these reasons, we decided to take a better look at the information and IOCs provided in the referenced report to see if there is anything more to be found about this Android malware.",

Since then, cybersecurity companies have had the malware on their radar, which hampered Rocke Group’s cryptojacking operation. In response, the threat actors updated the malware. Here, we uncover a revised version of the same cloud-targeted cryptojacking malware, which now includes new and improved rootkit and worm capabilities. We also detail the hiding techniques used by the malware to dodge cybersecurity companies’ detection methods, while explaining its four-module structure. We’ve named the malware Pro-Ocean after the name the attacker chose for the installation script. Pro-Ocean uses known vulnerabilities to target cloud applications . In our analysis, we found Pro-Ocean targeting Apache ActiveMQ (CVE-2016-3088), Oracle WebLogic (CVE-2017-10271) and Redis (unsecure instances). In the case that the malware runs in Tencent Cloud or Alibaba Cloud, it will use the exact code of the previous malware to uninstall monitoring agents to avoid detection. Additionally, it attempts to remove other malware and miners including Luoxk, BillGates, XMRig and Hashfish before installation. Once installed, the malware kills any process that uses the CPU heavily, so that it’s able to use 100% of the CPU and mine Monero efficiently.",

      "description": "The code behavior and features strongly correlate with that of the WaterBear malware family, which has been active since as early as 2009. Analysis by Trend Micro and TeamT5 unveiled WaterBear as a multifaceted, stage-two implant, capable of file transfer, shell access, screen capture and much more. The malware is associated with the cyber espionage group BlackTech, which many in the broader threat research community have assessed to have ties to the Chinese government, and is believed to be responsible for recent attacks against several East Asian government organizations. Due to the similarities with WaterBear, and the polymorphic nature of the code, Unit 42 named this novel Chinese shellcode BendyBear. It stands in a class of its own in terms of being one of the most sophisticated, well-engineered and difficult-to-detect samples of shellcode employed by an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT). The BendyBear sample was determined to be x64 shellcode for a stage-zero implant whose sole function is to download a more robust implant from a command and control (C2) server. Shellcode, despite its name, is used to describe the small piece of code loaded onto the target immediately following exploitation, regardless of whether or not it actually spawns a command shell. At 10,000+ bytes, BendyBear is noticeably larger than most, and uses its size to implement advanced features and anti-analysis techniques, such as modified RC4 encryption, signature block verification, and polymorphic code.",

      "description": "In contrast, Hornbill is more of a passive reconnaissance tool than SunBird. Not only does it target a limited set of data, the malware only uploads data when it initially runs and not at regular intervals like SunBird. After that, it only uploads changes in data to keep mobile data and battery usage low. The upload occurs when data monitored by Hornbill changes, such as when SMS, or WhatsApp notifications are received or calls are made from the device. Hornbill is keenly interested in the state of an infected device and closely monitors the use of resources. For example, if the device is low on memory, it triggers the garbage collector. In addition to the list of exfiltrated data mentioned earlier, Hornbill also collects hardware information. For example, the malware can check if a device’s screen is locked, the amount of available internal and external storage and whether WiFi and GPS are enabled. Hornbill only logs location information if it deems the changes to be significant enough from the previously recorded location – if the difference between the corresponding latitudes and longitudes differ by more than 0.0006 which is roughly 70 metres. Data collected by Hornbill is stored in hidden folders on external storage. Once call recordings or audio recordings are uploaded to C2 infrastructure they are deleted from the device to avoid suspicion.",

For this, Cloud services are often used by crooks including Google, S3 Buckets from AWS, and MediaFire file sharing service. The next diagram demonstrates how Javali trojan banker works. When executed, the Javali trojan starts its operation and immediately gets the malware configuration from doc files available on Google Cloud.

This file format is typically used for Windows Help files, but it can also contain active script components, in this case JavaScript, which launches the malware's processes. The infection starts with an email message containing a legitimate-looking subject line that seems to relate to a business. The email contains a RAR attachment with a slightly unusual filename extension. The usual filename extension for RAR files is .rar. However, RAR-compressed archives can also be split into multi-volume archives. In this case, the filename creates files with the RAR extension named r00 and onwards with the .chm file extension. This naming scheme is used by the Masslogger campaign, presumably to bypass any programs that would block the email attachment based on its file extension. CHM is a compiled HTML file that contains an embedded HTML file with JavaScript code to start the active infection process. Every stage of the infection is obfuscated to avoid detection using simple signatures.",

In the past, Sophos and other security experts have bundled the discussion of the malware itself with analysis of the delivery mechanism, but as this method has been adopted to deliver a wider range of malicious code, we assert that this mechanism deserves scrutiny (and its own name), distinct from its payload, which is why we’ve decided to call it Gootloader. In addition to the REvil and Gootkit payloads, Gootloader has been used most recently to deliver the Kronos trojan and Cobalt Strike. In its latest attempts to evade detection by endpoint security tools, Gootloader has moved as much of its infection infrastructure to a fileless methodology as possible. While it isn’t completely fileless, these techniques are effective at evading detection over a network – right up to the point where the malicious activity trips over behavioral detection rules.",

Bitdefender has just uncovered a series of improvements to the BADHATCH backdoor aiming to improve persistence and data collection (grabbing screenshots and file uploads) The BADHATCH malware is a mature, highly advanced backdoor that uses several evasion and defense techniques. The new backdoor also attempts to evade security monitoring by using TLS encryption to conceal Powershell commands. Living off the land attacks call for additional defenses to complement behavioral- and commandline detection. Endpoint Detection and Remediation increases the chances of blocking and alerting as soon as the malware attempts discovery and lateral movement.",

This actor has predominantly used BazaLoader since April of 2020, but on February 3rd, 2021 they distributed a new malware we are calling NimzaLoader. One of NimzaLoader’s distinguishing features is that it is written in the Nim programming language. Malware written in Nim are rare in the threat landscape. Malware developers may choose to use a rare programming language to avoid detection, as reverse engineers may not be familiar with Nim’s implementation, or focused on developing detection for it, and therefore tools and sandboxes may struggle to analyze samples of it.",
