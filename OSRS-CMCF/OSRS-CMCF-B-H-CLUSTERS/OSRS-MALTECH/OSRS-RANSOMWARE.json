It will then encrypt all files on the victim's computer other than those found whose full pathnames contain the following strings - programdata, recycle.bin, program files, windows, all users, appdata, read_me.txt, autoexec.bat, desktop.ini, autorun.inf, ntuser.dat, iconcache.db, bootsect.bak, boot.ini, ntuser.dat.log, and thumbs.db. Unlike the previous non-encryption version, the working DeathRansom variants do not append an extension to encrypted files and they just retain their original name. The data in these files is encrypted. In every folder that a file is encrypted, the ransomware will create a ransom note named read_me.txt that contains a unique LOCK-ID for the victim and an email address to contact the ransomware developer or affiliate. One strange thing that was noticed is that numerous victims who have been infected by DeathRansom were also infected by the STOP Ransomware.",
