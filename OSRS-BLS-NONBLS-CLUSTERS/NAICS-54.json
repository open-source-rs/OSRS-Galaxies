Past members have contributed significantly to the medical community, with representation to the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists, The Australian Society of Anaesthetists, and the AMA. There are usually 14-16 full group members at any one time, and 7-8 associated anaesthetists who are mainly in the large public hospitals. Our anaesthetists work widely throughout Perths expanding hospital network, with many of Perths most respected surgeons, providing comprehensive services to patients undergoing a wide variety of procedures. This includes patients of all ages, and often quite unwell patients needing intensive anaesthesia care and the experience that goes with it. All of our anaesthetists are required to maintain high levels of continuing professional development, and participate in relevant workshops and simulations. This is combined with quality assurance and peer review. Combined with the high levels of training involved to become a specialist after medical school, this reflects that Australia has the reputation of providing the safest level of anaesthesia care in the world.",

The site was run by in-game volunteer administrators and moderators. At its peak, its server allowed for 9,100 players to be online at the same time. Dueling Network started on May 8, 2011 and officially released on May 17, 2011. After the release, the site's popularity grew quickly, and as of 2013, had acquired more than three million registered users. The site provided users with various in-game messaging systems. From the main menu, players were able to access the Duel Room, construct Decks, check players' rankings and profiles, edit their own profiles and change their account passwords. The game was intended to be a simulation of the real-life card game and as such, was set to be played manually with little in-game automation. It followed official Konami policy as closely as possible.",

The software package is published by Aptoide S.A., a for-profit company incorporated in November 2011 and headquartered in Lisbon, Portugal. There are several versions of the Aptoide app - Aptoide for smartphones and tablets, Aptoide TV – an edition for smart TVs and STBs, Aptoide VR and Aptoide Kids – developed for children's devices. The Android application used to access the stores is open source, and there are several forks such as F-Droid. The communication between the client and servers is done using an open protocol based on XML. The concept is inspired by the APT packaging manager, which can work with multiple sources (repositories). When the user wants a package, they can use the client to search for sources where the application is stored. The name Aptoide is formed from the words APT (the Debian package manager) and oide (the last syllable of Android). As of 2017, the Aptoide platform software had been downloaded about 6 billion times, was used by about 200 million users, and was available in about 40 languages. In the various stores, it is possible to find about 1 million Android apps.",
