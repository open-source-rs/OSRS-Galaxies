In 1962, Onondaga Library System was organized as a cooperative non-profit association of SPL and other member libraries in Onondaga County, to provide shared services that would not have been economically feasible if attempted by individual libraries. Following recommendations of a special committee formed to explore cost-saving consolidation, on January 1, 1976, SPL and OLS ceased independent operations and became the Onondaga County Public Library, with the city paying for branch library services and the county funding the remaining costs. Some funding is received through the State, grant monies and private contributions. Today, the Central Library is housed in the Galleries of Syracuse, a modern mixed-use facility combining offices and retail stores.",

The Polish physician Ludwik Rajchman is widely regarded as the founder of UNICEF and observed as its first chairman from 1946 to 1950, when he had to flee the United States in the wake of McCarthyism. Rajchman is to this day the only person that served as UNICEF's Chairman for longer than 2 years. On Rajchman's suggestion, the American Maurice Pate was appointed first executive director, serving from 1947 until his death in 1965. In 1950, UNICEF's mandate was extended to address the long-term needs of children and women in developing countries everywhere. In 1953 it became a permanent part of the United Nations System, and the words international and emergency were dropped from the organization's name, though it retained the original acronym, UNICEF.",

WAPA was created by the Fifth Legislature of the Virgin Islands in 1964 through Act No. 1248. The enabling legislation has been amended to add the responsibility of installing and maintaining street lights to the utility mission. In later years, the responsibility for the production and distribution of drinking water was also added. Today, WAPA produces electrical power at plants on St. Thomas and St. Croix and distributes electrical service through smart grids to customers on St. Thomas, St. Croix, St. John, Hassel Island, and Water Island. The Authority is under long-term agreements with Seven Seas Water Corporation to produce drinking water through modern seawater reverse osmosis facilities on St. Thomas and St. Croix.",

			"description": "Nunavut is the newest, largest, and most northerly territory of Canada. It was separated officially from the Northwest Territories on April 1, 1999, via the Nunavut Act and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act, though the boundaries had been drawn in 1993. The creation of Nunavut resulted in the first major change to Canada political map since incorporating the province of Newfoundland in 1949. Nunavut comprises a major portion of Northern Canada, and most of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Its vast territory makes it the fifth-largest country subdivision in the world, as well as North America second-largest (after Greenland). The capital Iqaluit (formerly Frobisher Bay), on Baffin Island in the east, was chosen by the 1995 capital plebiscite. Other major communities include the regional centres of Rankin Inlet and Cambridge Bay. Nunavut also includes Ellesmere Island to the far north, as well as the eastern and southern portions of Victoria Island in the west, and all islands in Hudson, James and Ungava Bays, including Akimiski Island far to the southeast of the rest of the territory. It is Canada only geo-political region that is not connected to the rest of North America by highway. Nunavut is the second-least populous of Canadas provinces and territories. One of the worlds most remote, sparsely settled regions, it has a population of 35,944, mostly Inuit, spread over a land area of just over 1,877,787 km2 (725,018 sq mi), or slightly smaller than Mexico (excluding water surface area). Nunavut is also home to the world northernmost permanently inhabited place, Alert. Eureka, a weather station also on Ellesmere Island, has the lowest average annual temperature of any Canadian weather station.",

			"description": "In Manitoba, there are approximately 12,000 children in Child and Family Services (CFS) care and 90 per cent of them are Indigenous. These staggering numbers today are the result of Indian Residential Schools and the 60s Scoop, both of which destroyed individuals, families and communities. With the number of Indigenous children in CFS care reaching crisis levels, First Nations families and children involved with the CFS system wanted solutions. Through community engagement events held in Winnipeg and Thompson, Manitoba, in May 2014, several hundred community members shared their stories about the CFS system. We heard about the challenges they faced while navigating the CFS system and the failures of the CFS system to operate in a fair and just manner. From information gathered during the community engagement sessions, the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs published the Bringing Our Children Home Report (BOCH). The BOCH Report offered ten recommendations that would immediately address many of the issues and concerns identified during community engagement sessions. One of those recommendations was the creation of the FNFAO; this office is an added mechanism to implement further BOCH Report recommendations. Since opening its doors, the FNFAO has completed intake for over 800 families fighting to have their children in CFS care returned to their homes or home communities. More families, parents and grandparents seek the services of the FNFAO each day and demand for services is continually growing. The FNFAO is unique because our mandate is from Manitoba Chiefs, our advocacy work supports the whole family and we advocate for First Nation-led solutions to address the CFS crisis in Manitoba. We work outside of the current CFS system, understanding that our work cannot empower a provincial system that has clearly failed First Nation children, families and communities.",

It is located in the southern portion of the Pannonian Plain on the border of the Bačka and Srem geographical regions. Lying on the banks of the Danube river, the city faces the northern slopes of Fruška Gora. According to the 2011 census, Novi Sad proper has a population of 250,439, while its urban area (including the adjacent settlements of Petrovaradin and Sremska Kamenica) comprises 277,522 inhabitants. The population of the administrative area of the city totals 341,625 people. Novi Sad was founded in 1694 when Serb merchants formed a colony across the Danube from the Petrovaradin Fortress, a strategic Habsburg military post. In the following centuries, it transformed into an important trading and manufacturing centre as well as a centre of Serbian culture, earning it the nickname Serbian Athens. The city was heavily devastated in the 1848 Revolution, but was subsequently rebuilt and restored. Today, along with the Serbian capital city of Belgrade, Novi Sad is an industrial and financial centre important to the Serbian economy. Novi Sad is the European Capital of Culture for the year 2021, and European Youth Capital 2019.",

The Inquiry was set up in response to the Inquiry into Historical Institutional Abuse Act (Northern Ireland) 2013. Following a request to extend its timescale, the Inquiry's Report was delivered to the First Minister and deputy First Minister (who had no powers to change it) on 6 January 2017, shortly before the deadline of 18 January, and published on 20 January. The cost was estimated at 17-19m, with 30 people working on the enquiry according to its Frequently Asked Questions as of January 2017. There are provisions for witness support. The Inquiry had statutory powers to compel witnesses living in Northern Ireland to appear before it and evidence held in Northern Ireland to be given to it - to take evidence under oath; and to be held in public except where necessary to protect individuals' privacy. Inquiry Rule 14(3) does not allow any explicit or significant criticism of a person unless the chairperson has sent them a warning letter, with a reasonable opportunity to respond.",
